## Pose Sound

An interactive sound thing. Audio by [@iamalilly](https://twitter.com/iamalilly)

### How to make this works

1. Load the page here: [https://stuartlynn.github.io/pose-sound/](https://stuartlynn.github.io/pose-sound/)
2. Once its loaded hit 'c' to bring up the controlls
3. Marvel at all the dials and buttons for a while
4. Click 'paused' at the top of the controlles to get the audio started
5. Use the 'position' slider to simulate the iteraction and adjust each of the sounds
knobs till your happy with them. THe first knob controlls when the sound stars fading in
the seccond when it reaches full volume, the third is when it starts to fade out and the
last is when the sound stops
6. You can also toggle the volume of each sound in the seccond slider under the 4 knob
controll
7. You can remove a sound entierly by hitting the checkbox next to it
8. Hit save on the top right to save the configuration (so if you acidentally hit reload then
it's still there
9. Get a friend
10. Ask that friend to stand in front of the camera far back enough for you to be able
to see their entire body.
11. Make sure the pose algorithum is doing a good job matching their pose.
12. If it isn't try adjusting the lighting to better illuminate the person or make sure
that the background isn't to busy
13. Ask your friend to make a really big pose, arms outstretched and legs appart.
14. Press 'b' on the keyboard
15. Ask them to make a small pose, like a baby. Hit 's' on the keyboard
16. Finally check the 'track motion' checkbox and ask them to slow change from a large pose
to a small one and back again. It should make the circle larger and smaller and fade through the
different audio elements
17. If your happy with everything hit 'c' to hide the controlls.
18. Go get a beer cause that was a lot!

### How does this work

This uses the frankly wonderful posenet model. Learn more about it here : [https://medium.com/tensorflow/real-time-human-pose-estimation-in-the-browser-with-tensorflow-js-7dd0bc881cd5](https://medium.com/tensorflow/real-time-human-pose-estimation-in-the-browser-with-tensorflow-js-7dd0bc881cd5)

### I am neither of the creators (who are realistically the only people who will ever look at this) can I fork / use / show this thing to people?

YES!

### Really?

YUP, if you feel like it ping us on twitter to let us know what your doing with it... that would be cool and make us all warm and fuzzy

### Ok then, what are your tweets?
